==========================================

This is little messy "programme" that arranges music files into folders according to the artists who perform each song according to a database 'BandDataBase.py' .

I created it because I needed a script to tidy up my music files in to folder and then extend it to programme.

I have mostly improvised my way through creating it, so I guarantee you that it can be improved in many ways.

All in all, it does what it is supposed to do (at least in my computer[windows xp: service pack 2]), although, because I built it carelessly, it is a bunch of "spaghetti code"
